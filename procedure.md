# Procedure

## 1. **Define the Problem**

- The objective is to build a recommendation system for Steam games based on user reviews and ratings.
- Decide whether you want to focus on a content-based recommendation system, a collaborative filtering approach, or a hybrid model.

## 2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**

- **Load the Dataset**: Start by loading the dataset and inspecting its contents.
- **Explore the Data**:
   - Check the data types and ensure you handle missing values appropriately.
   - Identify key features such as user reviews, ratings, and game details.
   - Explore relationships between variables (e.g., ratings vs. game genre).
- **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove or fill missing values.
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., genre, platform) using one-hot encoding or similar techniques.
   
## 3. **Feature Engineering**

- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the review text (e.g., remove stopwords, punctuation, and apply stemming or lemmatization).
- **Text Representation**:
  - Use **TF-IDF** or **word embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe) to represent the reviews in vector form for model input.
- **Additional Features**: Create features based on game metadata (e.g., genre, price, platform, release year) to improve recommendations.

## 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Visualize the distribution of ratings and reviews.
- Investigate popular games, genres, or platforms.
- Look for patterns in user behavior or review trends.

## 5. **Model Building**

Depending on the approach you take, here are a few methods:
   
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-means clustering with PCA**
   
   
   
## 6. **Results Interpretation**

- Analyze the results and assess the quality of the recommendations.
- Identify potential improvements such as incorporating new features, trying different models, or tuning hyperparameters.


## Using Maximum Likelihood

To **estimate user preferences** using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** in your Steam game recommendation project, you can model the user-game interactions probabilistically. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
