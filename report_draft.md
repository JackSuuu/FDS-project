# **Steam Game Dataset Analysis Report**

---

## **Overview**
This project investigates the Steam game dataset to analyze game popularity, predict future trends, and build a recommendation system. The dataset includes information about games, their genres, categories, reviews, and pricing. The analysis focuses on understanding the relationships between game features and their success metrics, such as review scores and recommendations. Key steps included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering using K-means, and predictive modeling using linear and logistic regression. The results revealed that review scores and Metacritic ratings are strong predictors of game popularity, and games can be effectively grouped into clusters based on their genres. The project successfully addressed its objectives, providing insights into game popularity and a framework for recommending similar games.

## **Introduction**
### **Context and Motivation**
The video game industry has grown exponentially, with platforms like Steam hosting thousands of games. Understanding what makes a game successful is crucial for developers, publishers, and consumers. This study focuses on the Steam game dataset, which provides a rich source of information about game features, user reviews, and pricing. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns that influence game popularity and provide recommendations for similar games.

### **Previous Work**
Previous studies in this area have focused on predicting game sales and popularity using machine learning techniques. For example, research has shown that review scores and pricing significantly impact a game's success. However, few studies have explored the use of clustering techniques to group similar games for recommendation purposes. This project builds on existing work by combining predictive modeling with clustering to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Steam game dataset.

### **Objectives**
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To identify factors that contribute to a game's popularity.
2. To predict a game's success based on its features.
3. To build a recommendation system that groups similar games.

## **Data**
### **Data Provenance**
The dataset was obtained from publicly available CSV files, including `games.csv`, `tags.csv`, and `reviews.csv`. The data was collected from Steam, a popular digital distribution platform for video games. The terms and conditions of Steam allow the use of this data for research purposes.

### **Data Description**
The dataset initially contained 140,066 rows and 20 columns, with features such as `app_id`, `name`, `release_date`, `price_overview`, `review_score`, `genre`, and `category`. After cleaning, the dataset was reduced to 86,116 rows, with missing values and duplicates removed.

### **Data Processing**
The data processing steps included:
1. **Duplicate Removal**: Duplicate entries were removed using the `app_id` column.
2. **Type Conversion**: Columns such as `price_overview` and `review_score` were converted to numeric types.
3. **Missing Value Handling**: Rows with missing values in critical columns were dropped.
4. **Feature Engineering**: The `genre` and `category` columns were combined into a single text feature for clustering.

## **Exploration and Analysis**
### **Visualizations and Tables**
1. **Review Score Distribution**: A bar chart showed that 79.1% of games had a review score of 7 or higher, indicating a bias towards positive reviews.
2. **Clustering Visualization**: A scatter plot of the PCA-reduced features showed clear groupings of games into five clusters: Action/Shooter, Casual/Puzzle, RPG/Adventure, Simulation/Strategy, and Sports/Racing.

### **Analysis**
1. **K-means Clustering**: Games were grouped into five clusters based on their genres and categories. The largest cluster, Action/Shooter games, accounted for 47% of the dataset.
2. **Linear Regression**: The model predicted the number of recommendations a game would receive based on features such as `price_overview`, `review_score`, and `metacritic_score`. The RÂ² score was 0.61, indicating a moderate correlation.
3. **Logistic Regression**: The model classified games as "popular" or "unpopular" based on their review scores, achieving an accuracy of 79.8%.

### **Interpretation**
The analysis revealed that review scores and Metacritic ratings are strong predictors of a game's popularity. The clustering results demonstrated that games can be effectively grouped based on their genres, providing a foundation for a recommendation system.

## **Discussion and Conclusions**
### **Summary of Findings**
The project successfully identified key factors influencing game popularity and grouped games into meaningful clusters. The linear regression model showed that `metacritic_score` and `review_score` are strong predictors of a game's success, while the logistic regression model effectively classified games as "popular" or "unpopular."

### **Evaluation of Own Work**
The strengths of this project include the comprehensive data cleaning process and the use of multiple machine learning techniques to address the research questions. However, limitations include the imbalanced nature of the dataset, which may have affected the logistic regression model's performance.

### **Comparison with Related Work**
The findings align with previous studies that highlight the importance of review scores and pricing in predicting game success. However, this project extends previous work by incorporating clustering techniques to group similar games.

### **Improvements and Extensions**
Future work could include:
1. Incorporating user behavior data for collaborative filtering.
2. Experimenting with deep learning models for more accurate predictions.
3. Investigating the impact of release dates and seasonal trends on game popularity.
